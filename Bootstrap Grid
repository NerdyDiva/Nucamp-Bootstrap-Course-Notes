A way to create grid layout for a page. 
similar to concept of html table. this is a better tool than that. do not use those today. 
mobile first, responsive layout.  
designed mostly on css, especially the flexbox, along with media queries an breakpoints. 
viewport meta tag needs to be in the head along with the bootstrap link. 

for the bootstrap grid, rember that you will always need these 3 things. utilize the div tag: 
-container
-row
-column

container: fluid will make the row span across the whole page and looks good/adjusts to any size device. 
A row always has the potential of 12 columns. 
all content goes in the column divs only 

Breakpoints: 
if you don't specify a breakpoint size, it will default to x/s
you can specify a column to be a size and up and it will be that many units.
