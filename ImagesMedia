Image classes are in the content section of Bootstrap as opposed to the Component section
ONly a couple of bootstrap classes for images: 
a.  image-fluid: if your pic is larger than the viewport, the system will cause the screen to scroll horizontally. Add this to the css sheet
b. image-thumbnail 1 px border and rounded corners.  add this stright to the class. 

Media class: 
-add when you want to put a pic and a paragraph of text next to each other. div class="media" around the pic and the text.  Then add a div class="media-body" to just the text. 
Media object info is in the layout section of boostrap docs.
