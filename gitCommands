Objectives
Initialize a local Git repository.
Learn to perform basic Git operations: add, status, commit, and more. 

Instructions
Initialize a local repository
In your bash terminal, navigate to the git-test folder inside your NucampFolder (which should be on your Desktop). It's important that you make sure to be in the git-test folder before you proceed.
If you're not sure how to get to a specific folder inside your terminal, revisit the previous exercise's instructions on opening Bash/Terminal from a specific folder, or alternatively, you can revisit the first video about Terminal in the "Introduction to Command Line Interfaces" lesson to review how to navigate your filesystem. 
When you're in the git-test folder, your terminal prompt should look similar to this:

Initialize an empty Git repository with this command:
git init

Check your Git repository status
Type the following into your bash terminal to check your Git repository's status:
git status

Create a new file using Visual Studio Code
Open VS Code in this folder by typing:
code .
Note the space and dot following the word 'code' above - do not omit them!
If you are on macOS and the above command did not work for you, first make sure that your Visual Studio Code.app file is in your Applications folder and not your Downloads folder, then follow the instructions under "Additional Step for macOS" here. If it still does not work, close and reopen your terminal.
Create a new a file named index.html in this folder, and add the following basic HTML code to this file:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <body>
      <h1>This is a Header</h1>
   </body>
</html>
Again, check your repository status and take note of what it says:
git status

Add files to the staging area
To add files to the staging area of your Git repository, type:
git add .
Again, check your repository status and take note of what it says:
git status


First commit to the Git repository
To commit the current staging area to your Git repository, type:
git commit -m "first commit"
Again, check your repository status and take note of what it says:
git status

Further demonstration of Git
For the purposes of this course, adding and committing your code to your local repository after making significant changes is the most you will be asked to do, and even that will be optional. 
We will not require you to do anything else with Git in the rest of this course, because Git can be a complicated topic and we want you to be able to focus on learning the main course content. 
However, please follow along the below instructions for a brief demonstration of how Git can access previous commits.


Second commit
Now, modify the index.html file as follows, inserting a paragraph element:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>This is a Header</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    </body>
</html>
Make sure this file is saved, then in your bash terminal, type:
git add .
git commit -m "Second commit"

Third commit
Once more, modify the index.html file as follows:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>This is a Header</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>
Make sure this file is saved, then in your bash terminal, type:
git add .
git commit -m "Third commit"

Check the log of Git commits
To check the log of the commits to your Git repository, type:
git log --oneline


Checking out a file from an earlier commit
To check out index.html from the second commit, find the number of the second commit using git log, and then type the following at the prompt:
git checkout <second commit's number> index.html
Notice in VS Code how the code has changed. 
Try it again with the first commit -- use git checkout <first commit's number> index.html. (Without the space at the end of index.html.)

Resetting the local Git repository
To discard the effect of the previous operation and restore index.html to its state at the end of the third commit, type:
git reset HEAD index.html
Then type the following at the prompt:
git checkout -- index.html
You can also use git reset to reset the staging area to the last commit without disturbing the working directory.


Summary
In this lesson, you have learned how to initialize a local repository (local meaning, on your own computer), along with how to use basic commands to add files to staging then commit them, view the git log, check out earlier commits, and reset the repository.
