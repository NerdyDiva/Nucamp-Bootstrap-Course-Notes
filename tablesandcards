Bootstrap Tables and Cards
  HTML tables should be used for tabular data only and not design. 
    1. html character entity example: &lt(<)  &ge(>=)
    2. example table  
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>
          Blad
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      3. thead elements and tbody elements can be wrapped around rows optionally if you desire.  So, if you have a table row that is the header with all the key info, you can wrap it 
         in thead and then the remaining rows can be wrapped in tbody. If you do this, you would need to replace the <td> tags with <th> instead of the table header or rows wrapped in thead. 
         You can also change the first <td> elements in the rows of the body to <th> as well so that they style appropriately. 
      4. Table class in bootstrap
        a. defaults to have borders. you can also use table-bordered for all rows to have borders. table responsive to remove horizontal scroll bar when it's too small. 
        
        
      5. Card is a lightweight way for design. 
         a. card is a bootstrap class that you put in a div. 
         b. by default a card will take up the entire width of the screen or you can specify a width (style=width)
         c. you can also put the card inside a bootstrap container (grid) 
         d. by default the card has not padding or margin, but you can use the card body class to set off a padded section (div class="card-body")
         e. you can use card-header to set a header.
