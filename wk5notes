Functions: write once, use over and over again. 
multiple ways to write, but the function declaration is the oldest way. 
first part of syntax is function keyword then a unique function name to call the function later. 

hoisted means that at runtime javascript will move all functions to the top of their scope 
difference between event handlers vs event listeners is that with listeners, you can have more than one element event listener. 
functions in javascript don't need "" quotation marks around them.
var has function block scope only. 
const and let have block scope which is any code including but not limited to functions. they can work in any block of code. 
Global scope is accessible to your project.  this is prone to bugs.
